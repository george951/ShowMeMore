# ShowMeMore 

## Description

A simple image recognition written in python, which works with a pre-trained model called yolov3 a real time object detector and a pre-sets of weights

## How it works

This model applies on the image at multiple locations and scales, the high scoring region of it are considered detections

This model makes predictions with a single network evaluation and is very similar to **Fast R-CNN** algorithm

## How to run on Linux
